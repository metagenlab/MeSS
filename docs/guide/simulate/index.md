After fetching genomes in the [download step](../download.md), the pipeline processes fasta, prepares replicates, and calculates coverage depths for each sample. 

## Steps details 

## [a) Fasta processing](fa-processing.md)

## [b) Get replicates and calculate coverage](coverage.md)

## [c) Read and alignments processing](reads.md)
