# 3) Simulate reads

After fetching genomes in the [download step](../download.md), the pipeline processes fasta and calculates coverage depths for each sample. 

## Steps details 

## [a) Fasta processing](fa-processing.md)

## b) Get replicates and calculate coverage

## c) Read simulation

## d) Reads post-processing
