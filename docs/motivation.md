## Motivation

The intrinsic complexity of the microbiota combined with technical variability render shotgun metagenomics challenging to analyze for routine clinical or research applications. In silico data generation offers a controlled environment allowing for example to benchmark bioinformatics tools, to optimize study design, statistical power, or to validate targeted applications. This is why we developed MeSS, an easy-to-use bioconda package to simulate in silico short and long read metagenomic samples.

## Why not just use CAMISIM ?

At the time, [`CAMISIM`](https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/CAMISIM) was slow and it's dependencies had to be installed by hand, so I decided to write my own tool !

???+ warning

     CAMISIM will have an upcoming faster version written in nextflow !
     Go check it out at [`CAMISIM`](https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/CAMISIM)
