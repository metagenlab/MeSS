# Tutorials
Collection of tutorials to showcase `mess` usage examples.

## Taxonomic profiles as input
`mess` uses taxonomic IDs and sequence abundances as input for read simulation, making it compatible with most popular taxonomic profilers. In this tutorial, we used the output of [bracken](https://github.com/jenniferlu717/Bracken) as input for `mess`.

## Sequencing technologies
`mess` supports long and short read simulations, and below are some tutorials detailing the parameters to simulate illumina ,Nanopore or PacBio runs. 
### Illumina

### Nanopore

### PacBio
